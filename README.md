I often need to do "things" to images and movies.  While "things" are nouns what I actually need to do are verbs, but writing 'I often need to do verbs' just doesn't sound right. The 'things' are typically, conversions, resizes, extractions... but in this case the verb conversion is a noun.  So for example in the sentence, I like to do conversions the word conversion is a noun, but a noun is a person, place or thing, so the word conversion is a verb, but in the context of the sentence it is the noun.  So a noun is a person place or thing, but 'the noun' can be a verb... Man I love our language... but I digress :)

Many times it's faster and easier to things to files from the command line.  I don't these things often enough to memorize, but it's a real pain in the butt Google-ing or DuckDuckGo-ing these commands every time I need to do them.  What I need is a reference... this is my reference.

I use Ubuntu (Linux) and I make heavy use of ImageMagick and ffmpeg.  Most of the commands in this repo assume that you have the same setup.

I suppose you can set up Windows or Macs to use the same commands to do the same things, but that's between you and your computer...  As the kids like to say, I am not judging.

I have put all of my commands into a linux folder.  If you want to create a mac or windows folder and save some commands there then feel free.  If you want to add more conversions feel free.

I know this reference will help me.  I hope it helps others too.

V PEACE!
